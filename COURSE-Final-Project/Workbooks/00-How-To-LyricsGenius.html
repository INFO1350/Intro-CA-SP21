Yeah, what&#39;s the deal ya&#39;ll this Missy Elliott
Givin&#39; ya&#39;ll magazine writers, radio cats, listers or plain ol&#39; haters
A small piece a my album which is titled Under Construction
Under Construction simply states that I&#39;m a work in progress
I&#39;m working on myself
You know uh, every since Aaliyah passed
I view life in a uh, more valuable way
Looking at hate and anger and gossip or
Just plain ol&#39; bullshit became ignorant to me
When you realize in a blink of a eye
You walking down a church aisle
And that was meant for weddings and happiness
And realize the same church aisles are used
To view a loved one for the last time
From the world trade families the Left Eye family, Big Pun family
You know Biggie family, Pac family to the hip hop family
We all under construction tryin to rebuild you know ourselves
Hip hop done gained respect from you know...
Not even respect from but just like rock and roll
And it took us a lot of hard work to get here
So all that hate and animosity between folks ya need ta kill it
Wit a skillet
You don&#39;t see Bill Gates and Donald trump
Arguing wit each other &#39;cuz both of them got paper
And the they got better shit to do: get mo&#39; paper
So all I&#39;m sayin&#39; is, let&#39;s take hip hop back to the rope follow me
(Hard working, the star of the show)
Misdemeanor here!
(Hard working, the star of the show)
Mr. Mos&#39; on the beats!
(Hard working, the star of the show)
2000 Eternity!!!
(Hard working, the star of the show)
I&#39;m the star of the show, let the show begin
[Go to the Floor]
This is a Missy Elliott Exclusive (Set it off)
Momma say, momma sah, momma can you do this?
Talkin&#39; like you baddest when you just know dat is
Every time I come out ya&#39;ll be like who dat is
Be like more like Ashanti and be unfoolish
You don&#39;t really want to break it wit me
You wear Gata I sport the Fendi
My Lamborghini against you Benzi
Dirty diamonds and your ring see mine like cling cling cling
Ding ding ding ding ding ding da ding ding
I used to get so high they call me Ming Lee
Spiked up my hair done like Don King
Haters keep on hatin&#39; &#39;cause dem don&#39;t worry we
Dem don&#39;t worry we or me and Timothy
M I S E slimed out my bodee-ee-ee
Bang bang to the boogie ooh, wee
Playa keep on playin&#39; watch me do my duty

[Chorus]
Go to the floor (now tell me what you want)
Grab me a drink (now what you gon&#39;do)
I came to shake, shake my booty down down to the beat
Stand on the chairs (and dance like who?)
Dance like the freaks (now what you came to do?)
I came to shake shake my booty down, hype the party (Set it off)
[Verse 2]
I&#39;m underrated, glad I made it, independent operated
I never hesitated, haters keep me motivated
The beat is penetrated I&#39;ll let Timmy regulate it
And we laid it in the shade and drink a glass of lemonade n
Damn I&#39;m faded!
Ain&#39;t no other way to say it ain&#39;t that complicated
Ain&#39;t no other chicks gon&#39; ever make me feel like invaded
I keep droppin&#39; hits like water breakin&#39;
Two centimeters and I&#39;m dialatin&#39;
Radio impatient, pause, come on, check my translation
From my observation my fans is real patient
They don&#39;t wanna hear the lies so stop fakin&#39;
You&#39;re greasy like bacon, keep my stomach achin&#39;
If you wanna battle let there be no more delayin&#39;
I hope you did some prayin&#39; &#39;cause when I come swayin&#39;
Pop shu pop, pop, pop, yeah
Sometimes I flow sometimes quick
You was on the verge of kissin&#39; ass so slick
I&#39;d be on the verge or makin&#39; hits after hits
This the kind of shit that tell yo mammy don&#39;t forget

[Chorus]
Go to the floor (now tell me what you want)
Grab me a drink (now what you gon&#39;do)
I came to shake, shake my booty down down to the beat
Stand on the chairs (and dance like who?)
Dance like the freaks (now what you came to do?)
I came to shake shake my booty down, hype the party (Ohh)
[Bridge/Verse 3]
Everybody, move your body now do it
Here&#39;s somethin&#39; that&#39;s gonna make you move and goove
(New Missy Elliott y&#39;all!)
Hey DJ keep playin&#39; that song all night, on and on and on
Is the niggas over there, bitches rightchea
Yea yea yea yea yea yea yea jeyah
All night long I hope you all came prepared
It&#39;s five o&#39;clock and we ain&#39;t goin&#39; nowhere
Oh yeah, oh, ooh wee
And will the guy the cash choose me? (Oh yeah!)
Baby, I got a man I ain&#39;t seen lately (Go down to the floor)

[Chorus]
Go to the floor (now tell me what you want)
Grab me a drink (now what you gon&#39;do)
I came to shake, shake my booty down down to the beat
Stand on the chairs (and dance like who?)
Dance like the freaks (now what you came to do?)
I came to shake shake my booty down, hype the party
&quot;One two three four five six seven eight nine!&quot; - Chuck D
&quot;Are we on the air?&quot;

[Intro: Missy Elliott]
Uhh, uhh .. (HA?)
Uhh (HA?) uhh (HA?)
Uhh, this is - uhh, a Missy Elliott - uhh, exclusive
Uh-huh.. woo!!

[Verse 1: Missy]
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Ooh baby, what&#39;s your name? (HA?)
I love the way you&#39;re spittin&#39; the game
You made me change from thinkin&#39; all guys the same
You the type of guy I wanna marry in months
Got exactly what I want (HA?)
And ain&#39;t no fakin&#39; the funk
Your attitude is funk and you&#39;re makin&#39; me crunk (C&#39;mon)

[Hook: Missy - singing]
Yes it&#39;s real baby
Got me so crazy
Light my fire dirty
Like the way you serve me
Stimulate my body
Crunk just like a party
Ohh, you won&#39;t be sorry
My papi, I&#39;m yo&#39; mami
[Verse 2: Missy]
I&#39;m in your life to come and let you explore (HA?)
And take you on a tour
The kind of guys that be talkin&#39; that noise
Is the reason I ignore (UH-HA!)
And you the one I wanna take to MEET MOMS
&quot;He&#39;s a rap superstar&quot; (UH-HA!)
I wanna be the one
You like, I&#39;m sure to do you right

[Hook]
Yes it&#39;s real baby
Got me so crazy
Light my fire dirty
Like the way you serve me (Oooh Oooh)
Stimulate my body
Crunk just like a party
Ohh, you won&#39;t be sorry
My papi, I&#39;m yo&#39; mami

[Verse 3: Method Man (Missy)]
Is it real hon, if it&#39;s really real? (Let&#39;s chill)
Maybe pop an X pill (How the sex feel?)
Come and get your next thrill (You the raw deal)
Yo I&#39;m sayin if your man won&#39;t (Mr. Meth will)
That&#39;s amoré, all day, mind over matter
And my forte is foreplay, sex on a platter have it your way
Then who, serve you everything on the menu
And all that freak shit that you into?
Sweet lady, you drive me half crazy
Maybe, we can go half on a baby (On a baby?)
Poppa got a brand new bag
Hidden in the stash of his brand new Jag
Lovely, kick your shoes off and get comfy
We can bump uglies if you ain&#39;t got your monthly
Yes I, like &quot;American Pie&quot;
Tell &#39;em M-I-crooked letter-crooked letter-Y
[Hook]
Yes it&#39;s real baby
Got me so crazy
Light my fire dirty
Like the way you serve me
Stimulate my body
Crunk just like a party
Ohh, you won&#39;t be sorry
My papi, I&#39;m yo&#39; mami

[Verse 4: Missy]
M-E-T-H-O-D, Man
M-I-S-S-Y, I am
I came came to bang bang the boogie
I see you lookin to bang out my nookie
You want my cookies I baked for you rookies
Work hard they want me to bang bang and stick me
If you want my nookie you got to come quickly
M-E-T-H-O-D is ya wit me?
(Mr. Meth) is ya wit me?
[Intro: People in background chatting]
Yo, yo yo move out of the way
We got Missy Elliott coming through
Girl that is Missy Elliott she lost a lot of weight
Girl I heard she eats one cracker a day
Oh well I heard the bitch was married to Tim and started fucking with Trina
I heard the bitch got hit with three zebras and a monkey
I can&#39;t stand the bitch no way

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
When I walk up in the piece
I ain&#39;t gotta even speak
I&#39;m a bad mamajama
Goddammit motherfucker you ain&#39;t gotta like me
How you stuntin&#39; these hoes
Need to talk what you know
And stop talking bout who I&#39;m sticking and licking
Just mad it ain&#39;t yours
I know ya&#39;ll po&#39; ya&#39;ll broke
Ya&#39;ll job just hanging up clothes
Step to me get burnt like toast
Muthafuckas, adios amigos
Halves halves wholes wholes
I don&#39;t brag I mostly boast
From the VA to the LA coast
Izzy kizzy lizzy goh
[Chorus]
Millze cillzan sillzome plilzay dilzzouble dilzutch!
Hilzzoo?
My gizzirl!
Brillzing her izzin!
Izzo kizzay!
Izzall rizzight...
Izzo kizzay!
Izzall rizzight! Nizzow wizzee wilzzo-izzo-zee!

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
When I pull up in my whip
Bitches wanna talk shit
I&#39;m driving I&#39;m glad and I&#39;m styling
In these muthafuckas ask, did you see it?
I&#39;m gripping these curbs
Skrrt Did ya heard?
I love em, my feathers, my furs
I fly like a bird
Chicken heads on the prowl
Who you trying fuck now?
Now you ain&#39;t getting loud
Better calm down &#39;for I smack your ass down
I need my drums bass high
Has to be my snare, strings, horns, yes
I need my Tim sound
Right, left
Izzy kizzy looky here
[Chorus]
Millze cillzan sillzome plilzay dilzzouble dilzutch!
Hilzzoo?
My gizzirl!
Brillzing her izzin!
Izzo kizzay!
Izzall rizzight...
Izzo kizzay!
Izzall rizzight! Nizzow wizzee wilzzo-izzo-zee!

[Bridge: Missy]
I don&#39;t go out my house shorty
You just waiting to see
Who gon&#39; roll up in the club and then report that next week
Just wanna see who I am fucking boy
Sniffing some coke
I know by the time I finish this line Imma hear this on the radio

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Stepped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he&#39;s on the grind
Please let me know if he&#39;s on your mind
And respect you&#39;ll give me
Ludacris I live loud like Timmy
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it&#39;s not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite
Hard to the core
Core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Yahh

Salt n Pepa, Lyte, EPMD, LL, Run-DMC
KRS-One, Rakim
Most of them artists used to dance
And still get respected in the street
Don&#39;t be scared to Bankhead or Bogo
Or move as far as sold Michael Jackson 43 million
Shoot, errbody have the zipper jacket
And half of these thugs have the glove to match, ya feel me?
Yo, it&#39;s ok though, if you wanna be hard and ice grill
And Harlem Shake at the same time, whatever
Let&#39;s just have fun, it&#39;s hip-hop man, this is hip-hop!

Yes, turn the volume up

This is an exclusive (Turn the volume up)

[Verse 1: Missy]
It&#39;s very necessary, on the contrary
No you do not scare me, is you drinkin&#39; Bloody Mary?
But shit, you betta hurry, before I have to bury
My attitude is bitchy, cuz my period is heavy
I used to drive a Chevy, put twenties on that Bevy
My nigga was the shit, but then that stupid nigga left me
And now I&#39;m lovin&#39; Larry, but Larry go with Terri
And Terri is a freak, but it&#39;s his baby she will carry
The life he live&#39;s a fairy, cartoon like &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;
My flow is legendary and your style is temporary
Yeah, you need to worry, like Jason, it gets scary
The words that I spit don&#39;t fit in that category
Is my vision blurry? My speech is very slurry
Me without Tim is like Jamaicans with no curry
And yes, it&#39;s necessary, so hurry, nigga, hurry
Cuz when this album drops, you whack MC&#39;s will all get burried

Repeat, you&#39;ll lose your teeth and I would hate to call you gummy
Rainy or sunny, battle no way, honey
This not a game of Hide-and-Seek, go call ya mummy

Hiding from me, cuz you know you are weak
You ain&#39;t sayin&#39; nothin&#39;, I keep it jumpin&#39; jumpin&#39;

Watch y&#39;all huskey, it&#39;s about that time
Gettin&#39; ready for the club &#39;round quarter to nine
Couple bottles of hypnotic in the back of the ride

But there is more things that keep a man satisfied
And I know the remedy just to cure him
From cheating even if he tried, hey

So he don&#39;t want nobody else
But me and only me
Pussy don&#39;t fail me now

So he don&#39;t want nobody else
But me and only me

[Verse 2]
I know he&#39;s a man and men have intentions
To sleep with someone else
But that&#39;s why when I make love to him
I&#39;m ruling
Try to give him my best, hey
[Chorus]
Pussy don&#39;t fail me now (fail me now)
I gotta turn this nigga out

[Bridge]
As long as the pussy good it&#39;s alright
Ain&#39;t gotta worry bout my man

And that&#39;s why he keeps staying
The pussy good, it&#39;s alright

Cos he know mine&#39;s is one of a kind
And that&#39;s why he keeps staying

[Verse 3: Missy distorted (Missy)]
Look ma

We just love the booty
All we see, in 3D, is um

So he don&#39;t want nobody else
But me and only me
What&#39;s the deal y&#39;all?
I don&#39;t mean to come thru and break y&#39;all vibe
But, I just gotta slow it down for just a second, so bear with me
You know, first before I do that I just wanna talk about how people Always say: &#39;Yo that&#39;s too nasty&#39; and &#39;Why yo mouth so vulgar?&#39;
&#39;Why you gotta-why you gotta sing all these nasty records?&#39;
And all that, but I be representin&#39; for the ladies and
We got somethin&#39; to say, we&#39;ve been quiet too long
Lady-like, very patient
We ain&#39;t get mad when Prince had his ass out
We thought he was gonna turn around to the front
And have the front out too! But you know, that didn&#39;t happen
We always had to deal with-with the guys
You know, talkin&#39; about how they gon&#39; wear us out on records
And-and you know so I had to do records that was strictly--
Representin&#39; for my ladies and how to keep yo man
Keep his eyes from wandering, looking around
And, sex is not a topic that we should always sweep under the rug
I&#39;m not sayin&#39; go out and do it, but if you do
Strap it up, before you smack it up
Flip it, slow it down, oh no!
Jimmy, drop it

My twinkies look stinky on the Benz
And don&#39;t I gotta look sweet for my mens
And make &#39;em think I got a whole bunch of paper
And even date a ball player from the Lakers
Now fake a take and make &#39;em holler at cha later
Shake em Wake em and tell &#39;em what to get my ass from Jacob&#39;s
That&#39;s the way a real diva like to floss it
Buy a car no matter what is costs
Of course my Rolls Royces make &#39;em nauseous
Tell you who the motherfucking boss is
I&#39;m driving, you walking that&#39;s why you talking
See the chrome spinning on the wheels stop jocking
I`mma let you know real nice and slow
I&#39;d be broke as a joke if I had to be a ho
So poor, Missy on the rise like the sun
If you think that I`m done, I ain`t even begun

Teeny, Weeny, now hate me like you hate to eat your Wheaties
Now here&#39;s a freebie, I`mma let you see me on T.V
Accepting my Emmy or a Grammy in Miami
I hit you with the one, two, whammy
You no tooth granny, with a hole in her panties
And I don&#39;t give a shit if you can&#39;t stand me
Cause I is what I is, and what I am is like my Mammy
And I don&#39;t mean to sound too petty
But they use to call me Fatty until I got with Puff Daddy

And yes it&#39;s my concern that:
Your chain Platinum or is it really Sterling?

Behind every curtain is a snake bitch lurking and she about to catch a hurtin
Mr. Moes on the beats
And Missy be the beats behind the beats
My record sales don&#39;t jump or do leaps
And while you sleep I&#39;m on the ground as I creep (you should creep)
I got Pumas on my feet
Fresh gear everyday, all week
You know I keep it hot for my peeps
Never cheap underground like the streets
[Hook]
Slide, Slide, Dip, Dip, Shake
Move it all around
Move it all around
Slide, Slide, Dip, Dip, Shake
Move it all around
Move it all around
[Intro]
Imma beat y&#39;all, play that beat (5x)
(This is a Missy Elliott exclusive)

[1st Verse]
When you wanna go around the world (I&#39;m ready)
And if you want me to fight your ex-girl for you (I&#39;m ready 2x)
If you need me to cook you meals (I&#39;m ready)
And if you want me to come and chill with you boy (Suga&#39; I&#39;m ready)

[Chorus]
You don&#39;t know how you got me
I&#39;ve never been in so, but not me
I was always told not to be
Givin&#39; up the [cat] easy

Something you do reminds me
Friends be tryin&#39; to stop me
They can&#39;t believe you got me
Givin&#39; up the [cat] easy

[2nd Verse]
When you need a backrub from working all day (I&#39;m ready)
Uh when you need a chick to come over right away (I&#39;m ready) (Like this)
When you need me to wash your clothes boy (I&#39;m ready)
When you need me on the phone to curse out the hoes (Suga&#39; I&#39;m ready)
[Chorus]

Boy there ain&#39;t none quite like you
Ask me and I&#39;ll always do
Cuz&#39; I got this thing for you
You know what a little [cat] can do
[Repeat]

[Chorus]

I&#39;m ready when your baby momma trips
So just call me come in doin&#39; backwards flips
My darling
Would you like me bust her lips
Cuz&#39; I&#39;m ready, show you I&#39;m the realest chick
And I love you
I&#39;ll do what you want me to do
I said I love you
For you I&#39;m more than a crew
I&#39;m Mrs. Do-right
Can&#39;t go wrong with me
I said R-E-D-Y
Always on time
Uh, come on
(Intro: Missy)
This is another Missy Elliot exclusive

[Verse 1: Missy]
I remember when yo ass was broke, so in love wit me
You were always at home, always talkin bout
&quot;loan me this, loan me that, now gimme gimme&quot;
And then ya got doe, and decide ya wanna leave
Gotta few chicks checkin for ya now, huh, you forgot about me
(Ain&#39;t it funny)

[Chorus]
When ya man gets money
I bet you can&#39;t find him
But when he come home beggin
You can&#39;t deny him
Where he at when you need him?
(he&#39;s out lookin cute)
But when he need a few dollers
He know who to run to

[Verse 2]
We would go out, I had to pay for everything
I never had to worry about you fuckin &#39;round
You used to tell me &quot;Yea I love ya, No one above ya&quot;
Then I bought you clothes, I made ya look like a king
Then the girls started flirtin wit ya ass, huh, and you forgot about me
(Ain&#39;t it funny)
[Chorus]

[Hook]
I&#39;ll be the one you runnin to
When yo pockets is low
And you outta cash flow
And the chicks don&#39;t want you no mo&#39;

(Beat comes back in)

Be the one you runnin to
When you got no mo&#39; gas
In those buses, catchin cabs
And the chicks don&#39;t see you no mo&#39;

[Chorus]
(Missy)
This is an old school Missy exclusive

[Verse 1]
Look!
I ain&#39;t on no ra-ra shit
You dont wanna test how far Miss get
Me and Timothy cars got kits
But we don&#39;t drive around trying to prove you shit
Everyone tryna be that bitch
But there can only be one bitch make hits
I know I must make y&#39;all sick
Cuz after I spit, you beg to quit
I used to drive a six
And then I bought a Murciélago to sit
On the plush leather seats, forget
Am I on my own clit?
Yes I must admit
And my ass is it
Misdemeanor have you seen her?  I&#39;m the best it get
And those who try to test this chick
Where they at right now?  In peace resting in

[Chorus]
If you broke
Just say you broke
Cuz&#39; all you blowin&#39; up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you&#39;s a bum broke nigga that&#39;s for sure
I know you broke, just say you broke
Cuz&#39; all you blowin&#39; up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you&#39;s a bum broke liar that&#39;s for sure
[Verse 2]
Yeah boo you know you a joke
Wear a fake Rolex, call it a Ro
Act like you down with so and so
Ya whack on wax, bows I came to throw
I might just let you mop my flow
For my autograph take this flick to go
(CHEESE)
Miss don&#39;t say no mo&#39;
Cuz you know what I do
And you know what I know
And I don&#39;t think so
You don&#39;t wanna lose a arm or elbow
If ya broke then just say so
Cuz the Bentley that you renting
Yo it&#39;s got to go
Back to the black man store
Along with ya weave cop a new afro
Why you wanna make Miss stoop so low
But if you try to test me I just check ya slow

(Chorus)
If you broke
Just say you broke
Cuz&#39; all you blowin&#39; up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you&#39;s a bum broke nigga that&#39;s for sure
I know you broke, just say you broke
Cuz&#39; all you blowin&#39; up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you&#39;s a bum broke liar that&#39;s for sure
[Verse 3]
In old school we used to call out names
But I ain&#39;t tryin&#39; to give ya no fame
My credit card gonna bring ya pain
To know ya account just hold change
No need to wreck ya brains
Trying to see who Missy gon&#39; slain
I roll solo not with a gang
I don&#39;t carry guns kick ass wit a chain
Don&#39;t let me say it again
I don&#39;t carry guns kick ass with a chain
(WHASSSSA)
Like a Chinese man
Reverse it
(ti esrever)
Know what I&#39;m saying

(Chorus)
If you broke
Just say you broke
Cuz&#39; all you blowin&#39; up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you&#39;s a bum broke nigga that&#39;s for sure
I know you broke, just say you broke
Cuz&#39; all you blowin&#39; up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you&#39;s a bum broke liar that&#39;s for sure

Passed on and went away with God (uh)
But for your momma its been so damn hard
I hate to even hear her cry (cry)
Aaliyah she asked me why (why)
Would her baby girl go this way (oh)
Can you give me better words to say

[Chorus 1: Missy]
Come one day she&#39;ll see you again
With the same ol&#39; beatiful smile
Long hair and the voice of a hummin&#39; bird
You&#39;ll be singing them same ol&#39; songs
Aaliyah can you hear me
I hope that you&#39;re proud of me

Fly high wit&#39; your 22 doves

[Chorus 2: TLC &amp; Missy]
One day we&#39;ll see her again
With the same ol&#39; beautiful smile
Crazy but sexy cool
And she&#39;ll be rappin&#39; them same ol&#39; songs

But its never been the same since you had to go
Cuz the healin&#39; process will be long and slow

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott, Chilli]
Aaliyah I know you&#39;re in a safer place
You&#39;re face to face with the creator and our maker
And if you and Left Eye happen to chat
Tell her me and Tionne we know she&#39;s much safer
If you see Biggie smalls up in the clouds
Tell him he&#39;s still the illest emcee we had around
2Pac there is only one, Big Pun R.I.P
We say one (one yeah yeah)
[Chorus 3: Missy &amp; TLC]
One day we&#39;ll see y&#39;all again
With the same ol&#39; beautiful smiles

And y&#39;all be doin&#39; the same old things
The last time we seen ya
We hope y&#39;all can change the world

Gave her them back shots and got money out her ass
Now you can see me in the coupe like WHAT
Next time I&#39;ll hit her in that G5 TRUCK

From the bed to the floor, to the sink to the shower
With her back to the bed and her legs to the sky
I can go hard, know why, big girls don&#39;t cry
I had visions of Missy with her money by the tub
Ching! Ching! Jackpot, I think I&#39;m in love
