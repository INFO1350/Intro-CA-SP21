<p>In this homework assignment, you will collect Reddit posts that mention a certain keyword from a Reddit community or “subreddit” of your choice. To do so, you will use <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dmarx/psaw">PSAW</a>, the API wrapper for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/bcxguf/new_to_pushshift_read_this_faq/">Pushshift</a>, which stores Reddit data. This homework assignment will closely mirror our 04-Data-Collection/5.5 class workbook from Friday, March 2nd.</p>
<p>When you’re finished, please upload this Jupyer notebook to Gradescope (LAST-NAME-HW-5.ipynb).</p>
<p><em>Not sure which subreddit to choose? To browse popular subreddits, you can go to https://www.reddit.com/, scroll down the page, and look on the right-hand sidebar for “Popular Communities.”</em></p>

<p><strong>2:</strong> Now you need to set up <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">api_request_generator</span></code> to search for Reddit posts (not comments) that will meet four criteria. (4 points)</p>
<p>Here are the four criteria you need to establish:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a subreddit of your choice</p></li>
<li><p>a query word of your choice</p></li>
<li><p>an upvote score of 100 or more</p></li>
<li><p>a limit of 100 Reddit posts</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: You can choose whatever subreddit and query word you like as you long as you get at least 10 Reddit posts in return. For example, in the subreddit “TodayILearned,” the query word “triskaidekaphobia” only returns two Reddit posts (with upvote scores of 100 or more). So I’d have to choose another subreddit/query combo.</em></p>
