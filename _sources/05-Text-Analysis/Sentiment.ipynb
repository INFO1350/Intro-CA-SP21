    "# Week 3, part 1: Build your own emotion lexicon\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we use word counts to measure emotion? And can we go beyond simple positive/negative \"valence\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we looked at pre-built sentiment lexicons. Today we will work in groups to define your own lexicons for specific emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Robert Plutchik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plutchik) defines eight basic [emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion): joy/sadness, anticipation/surprise, trust/disgust, anger/fear.\n",
    "\n",
    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "\n",
    "Work with the other students at your table. You will turn in a single report to CMS. All students in a group will get the same grade, so make sure everyone participates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a shared spreadsheet doc, such as Google sheets. You can download these files in CSV format from the File / Download / ... menu option. Create a second shared document to record your notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a group in CMS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I've added a new optional argument to `score_counts` and `load_paragraphs`: `extra_words`. Discuss what this option does, and try a few different numbers using the default lexicon (`bingliu`) and novel (`christmas`). In your document, describe your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose an emotion or opposed pair of emotions. Plutchik's are a good start, but feel free to try others.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Brainstorm words that you think indicate this emotion. Put numeric weights in the first column and words in the second column, as we did for the file `bingliu.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download your lexicon, and change the filename for `load_word_weights` to that filename. Save this file as \"Version 1\", and keep a copy of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apply the lexicon to Dickens novels. Each student should choose one of the files in the `dickens` directory. Change the filename passed to `load_paragraphs` appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Discuss your results. Compare top- and bottom- scoring paragraphs in the different novels. Look at the raw and \"rolling mean\" time series. Find passages that score high and low in these time series and look at the context around those paragraphs. In your document, copy in example paragraphs and comment on whether they are correct or not correct, and why. Each student should contribute, put your name on your exma\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Based on the results of your initial lexicon, create \"Version 2\" of your spreadsheet. Add or remove words, and change weights as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Save this Version 2 lexicon as a CSV, and repeat the previous exploration. Document all of your findings in the shared document.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reflection. We will compare and discuss results in class. After that, write responses to the following in your document. Does your lexicon work? Was this process difficult? What factors made it easy or hard? Was your emotion easier or harder than others? If any other group worked on the same emotion, did they get similar results?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upload a zip file containing your written document and CSV copies of all versions of your sentiment lexicon files to CMS. Each member will need to join the CMS group to receive credit.\n"

      "0.00\tWe didn’t always live on Mango Street. Before that we lived on Loomis on the third floor, and before that we lived on Keeler. Before Keeler it was Paulina, and before that I can’t remember. But what I remember most is moving a lot. Each time it seemed there’d be one more of us. By the time we got to Mango Street we were six—Mama, Papa, Carlos, Kiki, my sister Nenny and me.\n",
      "-0.02\tThe house on Mango Street is ours, and we don’t have to pay rent to anybody, or share the yard with the people downstairs, or be careful not to make too much noise, and there isn’t a landlord banging on the ceiling with a broom. But even so, it’s not the house we’d thought we’d get.\n",
      "0.00\tWe had to leave the flat on Loomis quick. The water pipes broke and the landlord wouldn’t fix them because the house was too old. We had to leave fast. We were using the washroom next door and carrying water over in empty milk gallons. That’s why Mama and Papa looked for a house, and that’s why we moved into the house on Mango Street, far away, on the other side of town.\n",
      "0.02\tThey always told us that one day we would move into a house, a real house that would be ours for always so we wouldn’t have to move each year. And our house would have running water and pipes that worked. And inside it would have real stairs, not hallway stairs, but stairs inside like the houses on T.V. And we’d have a basement and at least three washrooms so when we took a bath we wouldn’t have to tell everybody. Our house would be white with trees around it, a great big yard and grass growing without a fence. This was the house Papa talked about when he held a lottery ticket and this was the house Mama dreamed up in the stories she told us before we went to bed.\n",
      "-0.02\tBut the house on Mango Street is not the way they told it at all. It’s small and red with tight steps in front and windows so small you’d think they were holding their breath. Bricks are crumbling in places, and the front door is so swollen you have to push hard to get in. There is no front yard, only four little elms the city planted by the curb. Out back is a small garage for the car we don’t own yet and a small yard that looks smaller between the two buildings on either side. There are stairs in our house, but they’re ordinary hallway stairs, and the house has only one washroom. Everybody has to share a bedroom—Mama and Papa, Carlos and Kiki, me and Nenny.\n",
      "-0.02\tOnce when we were living on Loomis, a nun from my school passed by and saw me playing out front. The laundromat downstairs had been boarded up because it had been robbed two days before and the owner had painted on the wood YES WE’RE OPEN so as not to lose business.\n",
      "0.00\tWhere do you live? she asked.\n",
      "0.00\tThere, I said pointing up to the third floor.\n",
      "0.00\tYou live there?\n",
      "0.00\tThere. I had to look to where she pointed—the third floor, the paint peeling, wooden bars Papa had nailed on the windows so we wouldn’t fall out. You live there? The way she said it made me feel like nothing. There. I lived there. I nodded.\n",
      "0.00\tI knew then I had to have a house. A real house. One I could point to. But this isn’t it. The house on Mango Street isn’t it. For the time being, Mama says. Temporary, says Papa. But I know how those things go.\n",
      "0.00\tHairs\n",

      "0.03\tI want a house on a hill like the ones with the gardens where Papa works. We go on Sundays, Papa’s day off. I used to go. I don’t anymore. You don’t like to go out with us, Papa says. Getting too old? Getting too stuck-up, says Nenny. I don’t tell them I am ashamed—all of us staring out the window like the hungry. I am tired of looking at what we can’t have. When we win the lottery … Mama begins, and then I stop listening.\n",
      "-0.03\tPeople who live on hills sleep so close to the stars they forget those of us who live too much on earth. They don’t look down at all except to be content to live on hills. They have nothing to do with last week’s garbage or fear of rats. Night comes. Nothing wakes them but the wind.\n",
      "0.02\tOne day I’ll own my own house, but I won’t forget who I am or where I came from. Passing bums will ask, Can I come in? I’ll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because I know how it is to be without a house.\n",
      "-0.10\tSome days after dinner, guests and I will sit in front of a fire. Floorboards will squeak upstairs. The attic grumble.\n",
      "0.00\tRats? they’ll ask.\n",
      "0.11\tBums, I’ll say, and I’ll be happy.\n",
      "0.00\tBeautiful & Cruel\n",
      "-0.08\tI am an ugly daughter. I am the one nobody comes for.\n",
      "0.06\tNenny says she won’t wait her whole life for a husband to come and get her, that Minerva’s sister left her mother’s house by having a baby, but she doesn’t want to go that way either. She wants things all her own, to pick and choose. Nenny has pretty eyes and it’s easy to talk that way if you are pretty.\n",
      "0.02\tMy mother says when I get older my dusty hair will settle and my blouse will learn to stay clean, but I have decided not to grow up tame like the others who lay their necks on the threshold waiting for the ball and chain.\n",
      "-0.02\tIn the movies there is always one with red red lips who is beautiful and cruel. She is the one who drives the men crazy and laughs them all away. Her power is her own. She will not give it away.\n",
      "0.07\tI have begun my own quiet war. Simple. Sure. I am one who leaves the table like a man, without putting back the chair or picking up the plate.\n",
      "0.00\tA Smart Cookie\n",
      "0.01\tI could’ve been somebody, you know? my mother says and sighs. She has lived in this city her whole life. She can speak two languages. She can sing an opera. She knows how to fix a T.V. But she doesn’t know which subway train to take to get downtown. I hold her hand very tight while we wait for the right train to arrive.\n",
      "0.03\tShe used to draw when she had time. Now she draws with a needle and thread, little knotted rosebuds, tulips made of silk thread. Someday she would like to go to the ballet. Someday she would like to see a play. She borrows opera records from the public library and sings with velvety lungs powerful as morning glories.\n",
      "-0.04\tToday while cooking oatmeal she is Madame Butterfly until she sighs and points the wooden spoon at me. I could’ve been somebody, you know? Esperanza, you go to school. Study hard. That Madame Butterfly was a fool. She stirs the oatmeal. Look at my comadres. She means Izaura whose husband left and Yolanda whose husband is dead. Got to take care all your own, she says shaking her head.\n",
      "0.00\tThen out of nowhere:\n",
      "0.00\tShame is a bad thing, you know. It keeps you down. You want to know why I quit school? Because I didn’t have nice clothes. No clothes, but I had brains.\n",
      "0.00\tYup, she says disgusted, stirring again. I was a smart cookie then.\n",
      "0.00\tWhat Sally Said\n",
      "-0.09\tHe never hits me hard. She said her mama rubs lard on all the places where it hurts. Then at school she’d say she fell. That’s where all the blue places come from. That’s why her skin is always scarred.\n",
      "-0.03\tBut who believes her. A girl that big, a girl who comes in with her pretty face all beaten and black can’t be falling off the stairs. He never hits me hard.\n",
      "0.04\tBut Sally doesn’t tell about that time he hit her with his hands just like a dog, she said, like if I was an animal. He thinks I’m going to run away like his sisters who made the family ashamed. Just because I’m a daughter, and then she doesn’t say.\n",
      "-0.03\tSally was going to get permission to stay with us a little and one Thursday she came finally with a sack full of clothes and a paper bag of sweetbread her mama sent. And would’ve stayed too except when the dark came her father, whose eyes were little from crying, knocked on the door and said please come back, this is the last time. And she said Daddy and went home.\n",
      "-0.05\tThen we didn’t need to worry. Until one day Sally’s father catches her talking to a boy and the next day she doesn’t come to school. And the next. Until the way Sally tells it, he just went crazy, he just forgot he was her father between the buckle and the belt.\n",
      "-0.06\tYou’re not my daughter, you’re not my daughter. And then he broke into his hands.\n",
      "0.00\tThe\n",
      "0.00\tMonkey\n",
      "0.00\tGarden\n",
      "0.03\tThe monkey doesn’t live there anymore. The monkey moved—to Kentucky—and took his people with him. And I was glad because I couldn’t listen anymore to his wild screaming at night, the twangy yakkety-yak of the people who owned him. The green metal cage, the porcelain table top, the family that spoke like guitars. Monkey, family, table. All gone.\n",
      "-0.04\tAnd it was then we took over the garden we had been afraid to go into when the monkey screamed and showed its yellow teeth.\n",
      "-0.05\tThere were sunflowers big as flowers on Mars and thick cockscombs bleeding the deep red fringe of theater curtains. There were dizzy bees and bow-tied fruit flies turning somersaults and humming in the air. Sweet sweet peach trees. Thorn roses and thistle and pears. Weeds like so many squinty-eyed stars and brush that made your ankles itch and itch until you washed with soap and water. There were big green apples hard as knees. And everywhere the sleepy smell of rotting wood, damp earth and dusty hollyhocks thick and perfumy like the blue-blond hair of the dead.\n",
      "-0.02\tYellow spiders ran when we turned rocks over and pale worms blind and afraid of light rolled over in their sleep. Poke a stick in the sandy soil and a few blue-skinned beetles would appear, an avenue of ants, so many crusty lady bugs. This was a garden, a wonderful thing to look at in the spring. But bit by bit, after the monkey left, the garden began to take over itself. Flowers stopped obeying the little bricks that kept them from growing beyond their paths. Weeds mixed in. Dead cars appeared overnight like mushrooms. First one and then another and then a pale blue pickup with the front windshield missing. Before you knew it, the monkey garden became filled with sleepy cars.\n",
      "-0.01\tThings had a way of disappearing in the garden, as if the garden itself ate them, or, as if with its old-man memory, it put them away and forgot them. Nenny found a dollar and a dead mouse between two rocks in the stone wall where the morning glories climbed, and once when we were playing hide-and-seek, Eddie Vargas laid his head beneath a hibiscus tree and fell asleep there like a Rip Van Winkle until somebody remembered he was in the game and went back to look for him.\n",
      "0.00\tThis, I suppose, was the reason why we went there. Far away from where our mothers could find us. We and a few old dogs who lived inside the empty cars. We made a clubhouse once on the back of that old blue pickup. And besides, we liked to jump from the roof of one car to another and pretend they were giant mushrooms.\n",
      "0.00\tSomebody started the lie that the monkey garden had been there before anything. We liked to think the garden could hide things for a thousand years. There beneath the roots of soggy flowers were the bones of murdered pirates and dinosaurs, the eye of a unicorn turned to coal.\n",
      "-0.03\tThis is where I wanted to die and where I tried one day but not even the monkey garden would have me. It was the last day I would go there.\n",
      "0.02\tWho was it that said I was getting too old to play the games? Who was it I didn’t listen to? I only remember that when the others ran, I wanted to run too, up and down and through the monkey garden, fast as the boys, not like Sally who screamed if she got her stockings muddy.\n",
      "0.02\tI said, Sally, come on, but she wouldn’t. She stayed by the curb talking to Tito and his friends. Play with the kids if you want, she said, I’m staying here. She could be stuck-up like that if she wanted to, so I just left.\n",
      "-0.07\tIt was her own fault too. When I got back Sally was pretending to be mad … something about the boys having stolen her keys. Please give them back to me, she said punching the nearest one with a soft fist. They were laughing. She was too. It was a joke I didn’t get.\n",
      "0.00\tI wanted to go back with the other kids who were still jumping on cars, still chasing each other through the garden, but Sally had her own game.\n",
      "-0.03\tOne of the boys invented the rules. One of Tito’s friends said you can’t get the keys back unless you kiss us and Sally pretended to be mad at first but she said yes. It was that simple.\n",
      "0.00\tI don’t know why, but something inside me wanted to throw a stick. Something wanted to say no when I watched Sally going into the garden with Tito’s buddies all grinning. It was just a kiss, that’s all. A kiss for each one. So what, she said.\n",
      "0.00\tOnly how come I felt angry inside. Like something wasn’t right. Sally went behind that old blue pickup to kiss the boys and get her keys back, and I ran up three flights of stairs to where Tito lived. His mother was ironing shirts. She was sprinkling water on them from an empty pop bottle and smoking a cigarette.\n",
      "0.02\tYour son and his friends stole Sally’s keys and now they won’t give them back unless she kisses them and right now they’re making her kiss them, I said all out of breath from the three flights of stairs.\n",
      "0.00\tThose kids, she said, not looking up from her ironing.\n"
