    "The dataset that we're working with in this lesson is the [Bellevue Almshouse Dataset](https://www.nyuirish.net/almshouse/the-almshouse-records/), created by historian and DH scholar Anelise Shrout. It includes information about Irish-born immigrants who were admitted to New York City's Bellevue Almshouse in the 1840s.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bellevue Almshouse was part of New York City's public health system, a place where poor, sick, homeless, and otherwise marginalized people were sent ‚Äî sometimes voluntarily and sometimes forcibly. Devastated by widespread famine in Ireland, many Irish people fled their homes for New York City in the 1840s, and many of them ended up in the Bellevue Almshouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using the [Bellevue Almshouse Dataset](https://www.nyuirish.net/almshouse/the-almshouse-records/) to practice data analysis with Pandas because we want to think deeply about the consequences of reducing human life to data. As Shrout argues in [her essay](https://crdh.rrchnm.org/essays/v01-10-(re)-humanizing-data/), this data purposely reduced people to bodies and \"easily quantifiable aspects\" in order to devalue their lives, potentially enacting \"both epistemic and physical violence\" on them.\n",
