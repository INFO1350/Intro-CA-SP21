    "### Why do we even need functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason we write new functions is to make our code more *modular* so that different pieces can be reused in new contexts with less coding than rewriting everything from scratch. This is a similar reasoning to why we use loops instead of copying and pasting code over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we've written the following code that  want to change the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "name = 'Goodman Brown'\n",
    "print(name.split(' ')[1])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "name = 'Hester Prynne'\n",
    "print(name.split(' ')[1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now say we want to change what this code does: instead of printing the last name, we want to print the first name. We can do this by modifying both print statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "name = 'Goodman Brown'\n",
    "print(name.split(' ')[0])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "name = 'Hester Prynne'\n",
    "print(name.split(' ')[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we have to make sure to make all these changes, and make sure that we didn't make a mistake in either place. This gets tricky the longer our code is and the more repeated parts of it there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we rewrite our code as a function definition and two function applications, we only have to make the change once:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def print_part_of_name(name):\n",
    "    print(name.split(' ')[0])\n",
    "print_part_of_name('Goodman Brown')\n",
    "print_part_of_name('Hester Prynne')\n",
    "```\n",
